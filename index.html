                            I like to think of myself as a pretty normal human. I'm a Sacramento native who grew up loving sports and video games. I was drawn to computers at an early age, and I took HTML classes all the way back in 2001 when I was a freshman in high school in Orangevale. I participated in the CISCO Create Academy, which led to me build my first PC at 14, and so began my career as a PC gamer. Equipped with my beloved GeForce 4, that PC took me to Azeroth, Vvardenfell, DE_Dust and beyond. My coding knowledge was basic when I learned it, and far out-dated now. Consider me a blank canvas.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            Fast forward a bit, I'm now 32 and spent the last six years of my life as a full-time REALTOR, a career that I greatly enjoy, but has its share of complications. I married the love of my life, Jennifer, this past September after several years of dating and a two-year engagement. For the moment we live in Citrus Heights with our chonk, a six year old Siberian Husky named Solo. These days my gaming habit is spent playing PUBG, MHW, and Rocket League, with a little Diablo and Skyrim thrown in from time to time for good measure. I follow the NBA and NFL, Kings and Packers holding my loyal fandom. I was fortunate enough to travel to Green Bay last December for a game, which was incredible. Basketball is my true calling, however, which is unfortunate for one standing barely 5'8", but I still play at least a few times a week. I love to cook (and eat), and I visit as many local restaurants (and breweries) as I can. I might just be your typical nerd, but I love Star Wars and Game of Thrones. I'm an avid D&D player, playing in three campaigns at the moment and DM'ing another in a homebrew setting I'm creating. It's a miracle I have any free time, but when I do love to write; I have a small online portfolio with the character stories I've written for myself and other role-players. 
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            I was drawn to coding for a variety of reasons. I need to create. I want a career that produces something tangible, something useful, and to have the power to create on my own terms when I choose to. Freedom in my life is something I have always valued, and the ability to work from a terminal anywhere in the world has great appeal to me. I'm excited to get this journey underway and I'm committed to continuous learning. I'm ready.
